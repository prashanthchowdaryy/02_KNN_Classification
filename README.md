# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Overview
KNN is a distance-based supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks.  
It predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.

## Workflow
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Selected relevant features and target variable
- Applied train-test split
- Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Trained KNN classifier
- Evaluated model using confusion matrix and accuracy score
- Compared training and testing accuracy to analyze bias–variance behavior

## Key Learnings
- Feature scaling is critical for distance-based algorithms
- Model performance depends heavily on data distribution
- Bias and variance analysis helps understand overfitting and underfitting

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Output
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
